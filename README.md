# Sensolligent Test Task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It loads an example API and presents the data in tabular and graphical form.  It adopts the [CoreUI](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-react-admin-template) library and uses [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for the API endpoint. 

## Running the project
In the project directory, you can run:

 `npm start`

## Firebase
This project has been deployed to Firebase. Since it uses a __http__ API endpoint and firebase runs on __https__ only, the browser needs a special configuration in order to run. See [This answer on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18321032/how-to-get-chrome-to-allow-mixed-content#answer-24434461) for configuring Google Chrome.
